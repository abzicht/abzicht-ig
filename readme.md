# abzicht

This repo contains all **chapters** you can find on
[instagram/abzicht](https://instagram.com/abzicht).  
These so called chapters underlie the rule that they must be purely generated
by (JS) code; **no photoshop allowed!**  
All chapters are written in JavaScript, utilizing the
[p5 libraries](https://p5js.org).

Have a look at the animations on [instagram](https://instagram.com/abzicht), on [github pages](https://abzicht.github.io/abzicht-ig/)
or clone this repository and dive in the code!

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abzicht/abzicht-ig && cd abzicht-ig
./install.sh # downloads required p5 code
./run.sh # assumes that python3 is installed
```
